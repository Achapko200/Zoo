    <p>
      Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks, legs, and distinctive spotted patterns. 
      Native to Africa, they inhabit savannas and open woodlands, where they browse leaves, flowers, and fruits from high tree branches, 
      especially acacias. A giraffe's height gives it a unique vantage point to spot predators and find food. 
      Despite their size, giraffes are graceful and can run up to 35 miles per hour over short distances. 
      They have a gentle disposition and are social animals, often found in loosely structured herds. 
      Giraffes communicate with each other using a variety of sounds, including hums, grunts and snorts.
